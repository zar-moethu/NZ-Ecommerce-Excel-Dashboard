NZ-Ecommerce-Excel-DashboardNew Zealand E-commerce Performance Analysis
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a fictional New Zealand e-commerce business. The primary goal was to transform a raw, 9,000-row dataset into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for business stakeholders. The entire project was developed in Microsoft Excel, demonstrating that powerful business intelligence tools can be both accessible and highly effective.

The Story: From Raw Data to Strategic Insights
Every dataset tells a story. The challenge is to find it. Our story begins with a large dataset of e-commerce transactions and a simple business need: to understand performance beyond just top-line revenue. We needed to answer critical questions about profitability, regional performance, and product trends.

The Framework: A Structured Approach
To navigate this process, we adopted a structured data analysis framework, ensuring a logical flow from data preparation to final visualization.

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset, though rich, required cleaning to be reliable. This involved:

Standardizing Data: Correcting inconsistencies in regional names (e.g., fixing "ManawatÅ«<-Whanga..." to "Manawatū-Whanganui").

Verifying Data Types: Ensuring all numerical columns were correctly formatted for calculations and date columns were recognized by Excel.

Handling Missing Values: A check was performed to ensure no critical data points were missing.

2. Feature Engineering: Creating New Value
To deepen our analysis, we engineered new features from the existing data:

Year: Extracted from the Order Date to enable time-series and Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis.

Profit Margin: Calculated using the formula Profit / Sales to provide a clear measure of profitability for each transaction.

3. Analysis and Insight Generation
With a clean dataset and enhanced features, we used Excel PivotTables and formulas to uncover key insights.

The result is a clear and compelling overview of sales trends, top-selling products, and performance across different regions of New Zealand.

Sales & Profit Trends: The dashboard reveals a healthy YoY growth across all key metrics, including a +2.83% increase in Sales and a +3.76% increase in Profit. The monthly trend chart shows seasonality, with sales typically peaking towards the end of the year.

Top-Selling Products: The analysis highlights the "Top 5 Sales Products," with Binders and Tables leading the pack. This allows for targeted inventory and marketing strategies.

Regional Performance: The map visualization provides an immediate, powerful view of sales distribution. It confirms that major urban centers are the primary revenue drivers, but also identifies potential growth areas in other regions.

Category Performance: While Furniture accounts for the largest share of sales (34.04%), the "Profit by Category" chart shows that Technology is the most profitable category, indicating higher margins on those products.

4. Visualization: Telling the Story
All these insights were consolidated into the final interactive dashboard. The design focuses on clarity and ease of use, allowing any stakeholder—regardless of their technical skill—to explore the data using interactive filters for Year, Region, and Customer Segment.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end analytical workflow within Microsoft Excel. It proves that with a solid framework, any dataset can be transformed into a strategic asset that tells a compelling story and drives informed business decisions.
