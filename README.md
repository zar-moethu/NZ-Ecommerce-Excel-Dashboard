**Learning**:
Every project, no matter how complex it seems, can be tackled with a clear framework and a willingness to iterate.Effective data analytics doesn't have to be complex. It's about starting simple, understanding stakeholder needs, and building a solution that turns data into decisions.

📖 **The Stages of Data Analysis**
This project followed a complete end-to-end data analysis approach. Here’s what each stage looked like:

*1. Business Understanding*
Every dataset tells a story. The challenge is to find it. Our story begins with a large dataset of e-commerce transactions and a simple business need: to understand performance beyond just top-line revenue. We needed to answer critical questions about profitability, regional performance, and product trends.

*2. Data Cleaning and Preparation*

 - The dataset was custom-built using the Python programming language and was cleaned and the final dashboard was developed entirely in Microsoft Excel.

*3. 🔧 Feature Engineering*
 - engineered new features from the existing data:
   - Year: Extracted from the Order Date to enable time-series and Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis.
    - Financial Ration calcuatilation including Profit Margin: Calculated using the formula Profit / Sales to provide a clear measure of profitability for each transaction.

*4. 💡 Analysis and Insight Generation*
With a clean dataset and enhances features, we used Excel PivotTables, Pivotchart and formulas to uncover key insights as showsn below:

📈 Sales & Profit Trends: The dashboard reveals a healthy YoY growth across all key metrics, including a +2.83% increase in Sales and a +3.76% increase in Profit. The monthly trend chart shows seasonality, with sales typically peaking towards the end of the year.

🛍️ Top-Selling Products: The analysis highlights the "Top 5 Sales Products," with Binders and Tables leading the pack. This allows for targeted inventory and marketing strategies.

🗺️ Regional Performance: The map visualization provides an immediate, powerful view of sales distribution. It confirms that major urban centers are the primary revenue drivers, but also identifies potential growth areas in other regions.

📊 Category Performance: While Furniture accounts for the largest share of sales (34.04%), the "Profit by Category" chart shows that Technology is the most profitable category, indicating higher margins on those products.

4. 🎨 *Visualization: Dashboard Overview*

The final output is a single-page, interactive dashboard offering a comprehensive view of business performance. Stakeholders can filter data by year, region (across New Zealand) and customer segment to drill down into specific areas of interest.

🏆 **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end analytical workflow within Microsoft Excel. It proves that with a solid framework, any dataset can be transformed into a strategic asset that tells a compelling story and drives informed business decisions.
