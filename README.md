📍 Project Overview: The Framework for Insight

This project is built on a key principle: effective data analytics doesn't have to be complex. It’s about starting simple with a clear framework, a willingness to iterate according to stakeholder needs and translating those requirements into solutions that turn data into decisions.

To demonstrate this, I analyzed a fictional New Zealand e-commerce business, with data covering the years from 2021 to 2025. The dataset was custom-built and cleaned using the Python programming language.The final interactive dashboard was developed entirely in Microsoft Excel.

📖 **The Stages of Data Analysis**

The project followed a structured approach, outlined in the stages below:

*1. Business Understanding*

Every dataset tells a story. Our project began with thousands of New Zealand e-commerce transactions and a clear mission: to answer the questions that matter most to stakeholders—what’s fueling profit, how do regions compare, and which products shape our growth?

*2. Data Cleaning and Preparation*

The dataset was custom-built and cleaned using Python to ensure data quality and consistency. The final interactive dashboard was then developed entirely in Microsoft Excel. This stage involved standardizing data, verifying data types for analysis, and handling missing values.

*3. 🔧 Feature Engineering*

New features were engineered to meet the needs of the analysis:
Year: Extracted from the order date to enable time-series and year-over-year (YoY) analysis.
Financial Ratios: Calculated key metrics such as Profit Margin (Profit / Sales) to provide a clear measure of profitability for each transaction.

*4. 💡 Analysis and Insight Generation*

PivotTables, PivotCharts were utlised and calculated KPI metrics to provide a clear, actionable overview of business performance. The dashboard highlights:

⭐ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
At the top, interactive KPI cards show essential metrics, including ***(2023 to 2024 growth)***:
Sales: $6,838,916.49 (YoY Growth: +2.83%), indciating sales grew by 2.83% in 2024 compared to the previous year (2023).

📈 Sales & Profit Trends: The sales and profit analysis chart shows relatively consistent performance across the year with a slight increase toward the end of the year.

🛍️ Top-Selling Products: The analysis highlights the "Top 5 Sales Products," with Binders and Tables leading the pack. This allows for targeted inventory and marketing strategies.

🗺️ Regional Performance: The interactive map visualizes sales distribution across New Zealand’s regions, allowing users to see which areas generate the highest revenue

📊 Category Performance: While Furniture accounts for the largest share of sales (34.04%), the "Profit by Category" chart shows that Technology is the most profitable category, indicating higher margins on those products.

*5. 🎨  Visualization: Dashboard Overview*

The final result is a single-page interactive dashboard showing a comprehensive view of business performance. Stakeholders can filter data by year, region (across New Zealand) and customer segment to drill down into specific areas of interest.
